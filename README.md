# Unclear Firebase Realtime Database Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Realtime Database error handling: unclear error messages that provide limited information for debugging.

The `unclearError.js` file shows how a poorly handled database operation leads to unhelpful error messages.  `clearError.js` presents a solution for handling errors more effectively.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have the Firebase CLI installed and a Firebase project configured.
3. Replace placeholders with your Firebase project configuration.
4. Run `unclearError.js`.  Observe the unhelpful error message.
5. Run `clearError.js`.  Notice the improved error handling and more specific error messages.
